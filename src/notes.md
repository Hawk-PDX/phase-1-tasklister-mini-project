# JS Project - Tasklister Mini Project

## Deliverables: (match the 3 questions below)

--- 3 questions when handling an event: ---

1. What is the target of the event we want to handle?
   [] - add event listener to the input field
2. What event do we want to listen for?
   [] - should be able to click some form of a submit button
3. What do we want to occur when that event fires?
   [] - I expect to see the task string that I provided appear in the DOM after the submit button
   has been activated.

<!-- document.querySelector(h1.addEventListener) => {} -->
